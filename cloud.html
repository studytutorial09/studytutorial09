            <h1>Basics And Technological Importance Of Cloud Computing</h1>
            <h2>What Is Cloud Computing?</h2>
            <p>Cloud ek badi interconnected networks of servers ka desigen ha. jese ki computer resourses ko deliver
                karne ke liye banaya gaya ha. or esme right location ka concept nhi ha ki data esme kha se aa raha h or
                kaha ja raha ha.<br>colud computing ek esi technology h jesme data and program ko internet per store and
                access keya jata ha.
                in outher words,cloud computing ek technology ha jeseke dura data and information ko internetke help se
                store and manage and retrieve kesaya jata ha.cloud computing me inter net per host ki gayi service
                include ha.</p>
            <p>agerbapni lanuguage me khaha jaye to cloud computing ek esa plate form h jaha duniya bhar ki infomation
                aviable h par kaha store h ye kesi ko nhi pata h.or ye infomation kaha share ho rahi h ye bhi nhi pata
                h. cloud computing me bahut sare resourseshote ha.data storage,server,networking,and application etc.
                esme data cloud me he store hota h.or ye data digital data ke form me store hota h or ye data ko bade
                computer me store kiya jata h.jese server kaha jata ha.
            </p>
            <p>cloud computing ko develop karne ke liye harddisk,data base ,software application ka use kiya jata
                h.cloud computing me service privateand public dono ho sakti h.ye serviceko three part me divite kiya
                gaya h.1 iaaS 2 saaS 3 paaS.
                example of cloud computing- google,amozon ,microsoftazure etc.

            <img class="img1" src="cloud-computing-models-in-hindi.jpg.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>cloud copmuting me some model</p>
            <li><b>Desktop computing</b></li>
            <dd>A desktop computer is a type of personal computer that is designed to be used on a desk or workstation.
                It typically consists of a tower or case that houses the computer's components, including the
                motherboard, processor, memory, and storage. A desktop computer usually has a separate keyboard, mouse,
                and monitor, which can be connected to the computer using cables or wireless technology. Desktop
                computers are often used for tasks that require a lot of processing power, such as video editing,
                gaming, or running complex software programs.</dd>
            <li><b>client server computing</b></li>
            <dd>A client-server computer network is a system where one or more computers, called clients, request
                services or resources from another computer, called the server. The server provides these services or
                resources to the clients, which can be located in different geographic locations. This type of network
                is commonly used in businesses and organizations where multiple users need access to centralized data
                and applications. The server manages and controls access to the resources, while the clients are
                responsible for requesting and using them.</dd>
            <li><b>cluster computing</b></li>
            <dd>A computer cluster is a group of connected computers that work together as a single system. The
                computers in the cluster are typically connected by a high-speed network and share resources such as
                storage, memory, and processing power. Clusters are used in a variety of applications, including
                scientific research, data analysis, and high-performance computing. They are designed to provide high
                availability, scalability, and fault tolerance, which means that if one computer in the cluster fails,
                the others can continue to operate without interruption. Clusters can be configured in many different
                ways, depending on the specific needs of the application.</dd>
            <li><b>grid computing</b></li>
            <dd>A grid computing system is a type of distributed computing system that enables sharing, selection, and
                aggregation of geographically distributed resources, such as computing, storage, and data, to solve
                complex problems. Grid computing systems are designed to provide access to computing resources that are
                not available on a single computer. These resources are shared across a network of computers, which are
                typically connected through the internet.
                Grid computing systems are used in a variety of applications, including scientific research,
                engineering, and financial modeling. They are designed to provide high availability, scalability, and
                fault tolerance, which means that if one computer in the grid fails, the others can continue to operate
                without interruption. Grid computing systems can be configured in many different ways, depending on the
                specific needs of the application. They can also be used to create virtual organizations that share
                resources and collaborate on common goals.</dd>
            <h2>cloud computing architecture</h2>
            <p>loud computing architecture typically consists of several layers, each responsible for different aspects
                of the cloud environment.</p>
            <h3>The layers include:</h3>
            <p><b>1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b>: This layer provides the basic building blocks of the cloud, such
                as storage, processing power, and networking. IaaS is often used to create virtual machines and networks
                that can be customized to meet specific needs.</p>
            <p><b>2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)</b>: This layer provides a platform for developers to build and deploy
                applications. PaaS provides a set of tools and services that allow developers to focus on building their
                applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.</p>
            <p><b>3. Software as a Service (SaaS)</b> This layer provides software applications that are delivered over the
                internet. SaaS applications are typically accessed through a web browser or mobile app and are managed
                by the provider.</p>
            <p><b>4. Function as a Service (FaaS)</b>: This layer provides a serverless computing environment where developers
                can deploy code without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. FaaS is often used for
                event-driven applications that require quick response times.</p>
